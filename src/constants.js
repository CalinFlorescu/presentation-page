        to gather experience in this field through projects from different industries like Automotive, Travel, or Gambling/Entertainment. \
        In this time, I've also worked on side projects in my spare time to understand different programming concepts or to test \
        alternative solutions that could potentially improve the solutions used at my workplaces. \
        At the moment, I feel very comfortable with JS and its frameworks like React or Node. I also really enjoy the infrastructure, and I have experience with \
        Docker, K8s, and AWS."

        Since my first job, I have had the opportunity to be responsible for my work. One of my beliefs is that one of the essential parts of the day to day job \
        is to help others and teach them what you know because the team can't evolve healthily without this. When I start doing something, first of all, I have to understand \
        how that thing is impacting the system, what is its purpose so that I can come with the best possible solution."
